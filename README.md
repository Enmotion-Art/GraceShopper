## 🎨 About EnMotion-Art

Welcome to EnMotion-Art, an interdisciplinary experiment by artist LE (Lee). The writings and images you will find here vary in subject matter from psychology to activism, personal journey making to mythic ritual and more. While each piece holds anchor within academia they are often intensely personal and share techniques and experiences that have, for better or for worse, informed how I see and move in the world.

A message from the lovely Artist 'LE'
"If anything you find here can help you, wonderful. If not, that’s ok too. This isn’t about utility. At first, I didn’t even know if this site would be something I shared publicly as observation can change so much more than we realize. For now we remain arms and doors open because the call came and I answered. I’m not sure yet where all this will take me, but I’m excited to find out.

For me, this work is intimacy. I reveal a lot here and that feels very vulnerable, a feeling that is difficult for me but worthwhile too. You’re here because I want to share that vulnerability with you. Please tread lightly, but also feel free to discuss and comment as you feel inspired."
